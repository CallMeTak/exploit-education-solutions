# Level00

This level requires us to find an executable program that runs as the "flag00" account. In Linux, if a file has a special permission called Set User ID (SUID), then that file will always be executed as the user who owns it, regardless of who executes the file.
We can find such a file by using the ```find``` command.
```bash
find . -uid 999 -executable - perm /u+s -type f 2>dev/null
```
We are currently in the root ``/`` directory so we specify ``.`` to search here.
``-uid 999`` only includes things owned by the user with a user id of ``999``.
If we run 
```bash
id flag00
```
the output will be ```uid=999(flag00)``` giving us the uid of 999.

``-executable`` only includes executable files.

``-perm /u+s`` only includes files that have the SUID permission. This is arguably the most important option

``-type f`` only includes regular files and not directories. and lastly..

``2>/dev/null`` is unneeded but it gets rid of the spammy error messages (by redirecting error output to /dev/null) spouting "Permission Denied" when ``find`` is accessing files/directories the current user doesn't have permission to access.

Anyways, that find command returns ``./bin/...flag000``. This is the program we're looking for, so we execute it and get ``Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!"``. So run ``getflag`` and level00 is complete.
## Why the SUID permission matters
As stated before, a file with the SUID special permission will ***always*** run as the user that owns the file instead of the user executing it.
This can be a security risk. Imagine a scenario where an executable file owned by the ``root`` user has this SUID permission.
This would allow any user to run that program as if they were root! This is called Privilege Escalation.

In some scenarios this is okay. For example, the ``sudo`` is always executed as root.
This is so it can give the user root access (provided the security policy allows for this). So when a user wants to install a package with ``sudo apt install firefox``,
``sudo`` - being ran as root - can determine if the user is permitted to have root privileges, and if so, provide them so they can install their program.

But in other situations, this can compromise a system. Imagine if ``bash`` had SUID set. Then any user could open a root shell simply by running ``bash``. This is an extreme scenario, but if someone were to exploit a vulnerability in
an application with SUID set, the consequences could be dire.
